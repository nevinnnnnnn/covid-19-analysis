# covid-19-analysis
In this project, we aimed to analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted different countries and whether there was any relationship between pandemic outcomes and national happiness indicators. We used two datasetsâ€”one containing global COVID-19 data (such as confirmed cases and deaths) and another with worldwide happiness metrics (including GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, and freedom scores). The analysis began with importing essential Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization. After loading both datasets into separate DataFrames, we conducted an initial exploration to understand their structure. We then cleaned the data by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and standardizing column names to enable smooth merging. Using the country name as a common key, we merged the two datasets through an inner join, ensuring only countries present in both datasets were included for analysis.

Once merged, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using various visualizations. Bar plots highlighted the countries most affected by COVID-19, while histograms and scatter plots helped uncover patterns between happiness factors and COVID-19 outcomes. For example, we explored whether countries with higher GDP or better healthcare experienced fewer deaths. We then created a correlation heatmap to quantify relationships between numerical features such as happiness score, GDP, and total COVID deaths. This allowed us to identify potential trends and correlations, such as whether happier or wealthier nations experienced fewer negative pandemic impacts. While some patterns emerged, we remained cautious in interpreting results, recognizing that correlation does not imply causation. Overall, the project showcased the value of combining datasets to gain deeper, more holistic insights into complex global events.
